~~This is a repository that serves as a college course exercise of making a website. Honestly, I don't know what I am doing, but I am doing "something."~~

It has been a long time since I have touched this repository. It has been 4 years ago when I entered college, unawares of what I wanted to do, or what I was even doing, perplexed and confused about everything. I suppose it is time to redo a personal website on a seperate repository, as this will remain in archive.
